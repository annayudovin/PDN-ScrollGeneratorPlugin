# PDN-ScrollGeneratorPlugin
Scroll Ornament Generator plugin for Paint.NET

From wikipedia, under Scroll (art): "The scroll in art is an element of ornament and graphic design featuring spirals and rolling incomplete circle motifs, some of which resemble the edge-on view of a book or document in scroll form, though many types are plant-scrolls, which loosely represent plant forms such as vines, with leaves or flowers attached. Scrollwork is a term for some forms of decoration dominated by spiralling scrolls, today used in popular language for two-dimensional decorative flourishes and arabesques of all kinds, especially those with circular or spiralling shapes."

The scroll motif is ubiquitous in the decorative traditions all over the world. Unfortunately, it's a pain to draw by hand, and the more complex of a design you want, the harder it is to plan out where and how to place the next swirl to keep it from looking stunted or artificial. I felt like the process could be improved with a bit of computation, and decided to give it a try with this plugin for Paint.NET (there's also a standalone app version to be found at https://github.com/annayudovin/ScrollPatternGen)

The plugin binary is a .DLL which needs to be placed in Paint.NET installation directory under /Effects. There's a .bat file included which should do it for you. After that, the plugin will show up in the Effects menu under Render->Scroll Ornament.
